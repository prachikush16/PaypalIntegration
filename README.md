# PaypalIntegration
This project demonstrates the backend and frontend  integration of PayPal payments using React, Django and Django Rest Framework. The backend receives the payment details from the frontend (React) and verifies the transaction using PayPalâ€™s REST API. Once verified, the backend can process and store the payment details securely.
